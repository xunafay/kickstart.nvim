# Neovim C# Development

C# is a powerful language, and Neovim is a powerful editor. This project is
part of a series of plugins that aim to bring the best of C# development to
Neovim, making it a viable alternative to traditional IDEs like Visual Studio
and Rider.

# Work in Progress

This project is a work in progress. It is not yet ready for production use, but
you can try it out and contribute to its development. The goal is to provide a
complete C# development experience in Neovim.

Stay tuned for updates and new features. If you have any suggestions or
feedback, please open an issue or a pull request.

# Existing Features

- [x] Solution file parser for loading nested projects
- [x] Project tree builder
- [x] Partially complete tree renderer

# Usage

Here's the recommended way to setup this plugin with Lazy.

```lua
return {
  "xentropic-dev/explorer.dotnet.nvim",
  config = function()
    require("dotnet_explorer").setup({
      renderer = {
        width = 40,
        side = "right",
      },
    })
  end,
  keys = {
    { "<leader>ee", "<cmd>ToggleSolutionExplorer<cr>", desc = "Toggle Solution Explorer" },
  },
}

```

# Roadmap

The goal is to eventually have as much of the functionality of Visual Studio
and Rider as possible, but with a Neovim emphasis on keyboard navigation and
shortcuts.
